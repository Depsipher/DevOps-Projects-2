# This project covers similar skills as Project 1 and helps to reinforce my skills of deploying Web solutions using LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP Python or Perl.)
This project will implement a similar stack, but using a different Web Server- NGINX. This server is also very popular and widely used by many websites in the internet.

# Step 0 - Preparing prerequisites
The same steps as project 1. Set up an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS
